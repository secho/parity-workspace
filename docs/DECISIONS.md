# Decisions log

Append-only. One entry per non-trivial choice: what, why, and what it rules out. Claude Code writes here during the build; so does Jan.

Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD · short title` then 2–4 lines.

## 2026-08-05 · Platform is named Parity
The name carries the central claim — prove behaviour is unchanged before replacing anything. Rules out generic naming like "AI SDLC platform", which is a category rather than a product.

## 2026-08-05 · Node + TypeScript across the whole build
One language for monolith, services, platform and traffic generator. Rules out .NET, which would be closer to Alza's real shape but costs build time that is better spent on the shadow harness. The authenticity that matters — MS SQL and T-SQL — is untouched.

## 2026-08-05 · MS SQL Server 2022 in Docker, not Postgres
T-SQL procedures on screen are the strongest authenticity signal available. Postgres would be more convenient and would immediately read as an exercise.

## 2026-08-05 · Agent built on the Claude Agent SDK with an API key
Anthropic's Agent SDK docs prohibit claude.ai subscription auth for products built on the SDK unless previously approved, and this repo is public. Rules out `claude setup-token` workarounds.

## 2026-08-05 · Parity is a client of a gateway, never a gateway itself
Alza already runs LiteLLM. A thin `LLMProvider` interface with an OpenAI-compatible second implementation keeps "point it at your gateway" literally true as a config change.

## 2026-08-05 · Write-set capture via SQL Server Change Tracking
Chosen over trigger-based shadow tables for time. Rules out per-table trigger maintenance; accepted limitation is row-level rather than statement-level granularity, which is sufficient for diffing.

## 2026-08-05 · `blocker` is derived, never stored
Computed from `oracle_class` + `oracle_state` + `domain`. A stored blocker can drift from reality and then lies on the main screen — the same failure the DSL rule in the presentation warns about.
